# hotel_booking_analysis
 Using Power BI, this analysis aims to understand the price movement as the booking date approaches the check-in date and identify business opportunity on its basis.
**Major Insights**
68.6% bookings take place within 3 days prior to check in. 
29% of the total revenue of the business is recorded within 3 days to check-in date.
As the difference b/w booking date and check in date increases,the average daily revenue also increases.
For high grossing months; Oct ,Nov and Dec, total revenue drops when the days to check-in increase.  However, this trend does not hold for August and September. 
In August, total revenue increases if people book 1 or 2 months prior to their trip. That is because people pay high on average/booking. This opens up a business opportunity.
If you get more people to make early bookings, the total revenue is likely to increase.
